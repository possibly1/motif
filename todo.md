- Make poster of ideas?


## Technical:

- Add spacer mapping for components - map it to the component? - need to map it with extra info like insertion index....
- Algo for finding n nearest spacers
- Spacers highlight when active - and expand slightly


- Spacing problem was a result of getting the drop spot from the node not in between the nodes.

- Add tree view for debugging
  - Add reorder
  - Add add
- Add make component
- Add assets (non-visual)
- Add hovering signal
- Add all attributes
- Add save and load
- Add style guide and use style guide variables via text.
- Add linting watch and fix all linting errors

- Fix dragging to point where it works reasonably well
- Add all components and all attributes for them
- Add Undo Redo

Bugz:
- On drop expanded components are not re-evaled

Refactor todos:
- Fix hacky global drag
